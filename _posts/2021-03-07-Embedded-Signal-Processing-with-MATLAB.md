# **Overview**
* Project in Embedded Signal Processing course
* Need theoretical background in Digital Signal Processing (DPS)
* For simulation, it is necessary to handle MATLAB
* If you want more information about its MATLAB code & DPS, visit my **[Github](https://github.com/KeunJuSong/Embedded-Signal-Processing-with-MATLAB)**

# Idea
* There are no specific idea in this project
* It is very important to realize **DPS algorithm** 

# Description
* 9 categories of DPS theory :
  1. Convolution
  2. Sampling
  3. DFT
  4. FFT
  5. 2D-DCT
  6. TF
  7. APF
  8. Digital Filter
  9. Audio Equalizer
* With main idea and features of each category, implement its algorithm in MATLAB
* More detailed descriptions of each part of categories are in my Github. Go and refer them.
